# Spam_Mail_Detection_Using_MachineLearning
Description: This project implements a spam or ham email classifier using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The goal of the project is to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content.

The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of a collection of spam and ham emails. Using Logistic Regression, the model learns to identify patterns and features in the emails that distinguish between spam and ham messages.

Key Features:

  ->Logistic Regression algorithm for email classification

  ->Preprocessing techniques for cleaning and transforming email data

  ->Feature extraction and selection to capture relevant information

  ->Model training and evaluation to achieve accurate classification

  ->Simple user interface for testing and using the classifier

This project serves as a practical example of how machine learning algorithms can be applied to real-world problems, specifically in the context of email spam detection. It can be used as a starting point for further research, experimentation, or integration into larger email filtering systems.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and adapt it to your specific needs. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
